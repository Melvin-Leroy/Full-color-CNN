# Full-color-CNN

## The project

The objective of this project is to use CNN architecture on colored images.

The goal was being able to create a neural network with good accuracy.

I manage to have 98 % accuracy on my train set and 96 % on the test set.

## The data

You can find the data on kaggle (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits].

## The CNN

You can find the algorithm [here](notebooks/Final-algorithm.ipynb).

Take care that depending on the where you store the datas, you'll have to change the two variables :

`train_data_dir`

`test_data_dir`

## Installation

To install the different packages, you just need to run :

`conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt`
